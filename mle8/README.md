Do:
1. Collaborative filtering recommendations that are based on ratings.csv. Use
  1. User based and
  2. Item based approach.
2. Content based recommendations that based on movies_metadata.csv
3. Hybrid recommendations (user based, item based and content based together) based on ratings.csv and movies_metadata.csv.

Try to train models based on the datasets (the ratings data is on raw format and at first you have to make users x movies sparse matrix) and test your trained models so, that you can fill empty cells on the sparse matrix (You can also make your own ratings for multiple movies and check how the model fills your unrated movies).
